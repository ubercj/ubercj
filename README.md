Hello, my name is Chris!

I'm currently studying hard to learn full-stack web development. At the moment, that means going through the wonderful open-source Ruby on Rails curriculum over at The Odin Project. I'm finding the material interesting, and I love the satisfaction of slowly learning how to build websites with more cool, useful features.

If anything on my Github looks interesting, don't hesitate to reach out to me!
