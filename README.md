# About me

Hello, my name is Chris! I'm establishing myself as a developer after getting 2 music degrees and spending the past 2 years working in the arts. I've discovered a passion for development, and I am eager to start working in the field and - of course - continue learning!

I'm currently studying hard to learn full-stack web development. At the moment, that means going through the wonderful open-source Ruby on Rails curriculum over at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I'm finding the material interesting, and I love the satisfaction of slowly learning how to build websites with more cool, useful features.

## From trombone to tech

I spent the better part of a decade studying music, earning a bachelor's degree in trombone performance and a master's degree in music composition. My experience in music has actually been incredible helpful to me. Writing a good piece of music is surprisingly similar to writing a good web application: breaking down a large idea into manageable chunks, writing incredibly clear instructions for performers/the computer, constantly testing and making revisions.

If you're interested in my musical background, check out the recording of my [master's thesis on YouTube](https://youtu.be/u-3f4oe45TE). Many of the skills I used to transform a single musical motif into a 20-minute piece of music for wind ensemble have proven invaluable to me as I start building web apps.
